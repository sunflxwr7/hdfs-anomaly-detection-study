## Abstract

This research investigates the effectiveness of traditional rule-based monitoring compared to supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches for anomaly detection in distributed system logs. Using the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) dataset, the study evaluates Rule-Based Detection, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Isolation Forest models. Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine whether machine learning approaches can improve anomaly detection performance over static threshold-based methods.

## Overview

This repository contains the code, datasets, experiments, and research artifacts associated with this study.

## Dataset

This study utilizes the HDFS_v1 dataset, a benchmark dataset widely used in anomaly detection research for distributed systems.

To support reproducibility, an archival mirror of the dataset is maintained at:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamaniwilliams/hdfs-v1-loghub-dataset-archive

The archive contains:

- HDFS.log
- HDFS.npz
- Event_occurrence_matrix.csv
- Event_traces.csv
- HDFS.log_templates.csv
- anomaly_label.csv

The primary files used throughout this study are:

- Event_occurrence_matrix.csv
- anomaly_label.csv

These files provide the feature matrix and ground-truth labels used for evaluating rule-based, supervised, and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches.
